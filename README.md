# 8 Bit Adder
An 8-bit full adder can be constructed using two IC 7483, which is a 4-bit binary adder IC. By connecting two of these ICs in cascade, an 8-bit adder is created to perform binary addition. The first IC handles the lower 4 bits, and the second IC handles the higher 4 bits, with the carry from the first IC feeding into the second. To visualize the inputs and outputs, LEDs are used to display both the input values and the sum, while switches control the binary values being added. The switches are connected to the 8 input pins, allowing the user to set the binary values. The corresponding LEDs light up to show the value of each input, either 0 or 1. The output LEDs display the resulting sum and the carry-out. This setup provides a clear, interactive way to observe binary addition in real-time.
